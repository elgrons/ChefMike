    <h1>I am currently the Head Chef at Breakside Brewery Dekum Pub in Portland, Oregon. I started my culinary career at age 14. I spent my high school career working at Togo's in Beaverton, Or. I worked my way from dishwasher to management. Went to a small college in Sitka, Alaska for Natural Resources Management with an emphasis on Outdoor Recreation Leadership. Landed a great job for 5 years with Pizzicato in Portland. I then went on to open a new location for Rose's Restaurant and Bakery(my first real full service restaurant experience.) Had a hankering to work in a brewpub. Started as a pantry cook at Bridgeport Brewpub in Portland,Or and made my way up to lead line cook. I wanted to use my new line experience and converge with my management experience. I then took a job as a sous chef at the very busy Pelican Brewery in Pacific City. After a couple years I wanted to move back to the "big" city. I was offered a job opening a small brewpub in NE Portland. It has now been 13 years as head chef and our pub/beer/food/brand is super successful. I also work as a private chef for small events.</h1>
